## constructor-destructor

* constructor 
    - used to initialize the data in class
    - `Gassy arr[n]` call constructor n times
    - `Gassy *justptr` Does Not call constructor, only when initialize it 
    - For Nested constructor, inner one first
    
* destructor
    - to save memory by destroying used class
    - destructor is called when hit `}`
    - so...destroy outer first
